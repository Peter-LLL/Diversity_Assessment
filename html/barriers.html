                <h1>Education Barriers in School</h1>
                <p>Hey, ever wonder why fewer girls tend to pick computing classes in school? Well, here are some reasons:
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Stereotypes:</b> You know how sometimes people think computing is just for guys? That can totally turn girls away from it. Research shows girls are less likely to sign up for computing classes if they think it's a "guy thing."<br>
                <b>Lack of Role Models:</b> It's hard to imagine yourself doing something if you don't see people who look like you doing it. Since there aren't as many female role models in computing, girls might not feel like it's something they can do.<br>
                <b>Limited Exposure:</b> Maybe you haven't had many chances to play around with computers at school or home. That lack of exposure can make it tough to get excited about computing and can make you doubt your own skills.<br>
                <b>Gender Bias:</b> Sometimes, girls get treated differently in computing classes. They might not get chosen for leadership roles as often, or teachers might not give them as much attention. That can really mess with your confidence and interest in the subject.<br>
                <b>Media Stereotypes:</b> Have you noticed how often girls in movies or TV shows are shown doing other stuff besides coding or working with computers? It can make it seem like computing isn't something girls are supposed to do.
                </p>

                To fix these issues, we need to make classrooms more welcoming to girls. That means showing them that computing is for everyone! We can do that by having more diverse role models, giving everyone a chance to explore computing, and making sure girls get treated just like boys in class. When we make computing more inclusive, we get to benefit from all the awesome ideas and skills that girls bring to the table!

                <h1>Industry Barriers</h1>
                <p>Hey, did you know that even though there's a huge demand for IT jobs, girls often don't get as much of a chance to shine in the field? Here are some reasons why:
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Stereotypes and Bias:</b> Sometimes, people assume girls aren't into techie stuff or aren't as good at it. These assumptions can make it tougher for girls to get hired or feel comfortable in tech jobs.<br>
                <b>Lack of Role Models:</b> It's hard to picture yourself in a job when you don't see many people who look like you doing it. Girls often don't see enough women in IT roles, which can make it seem like it's not for them.<br>
                <img src="../images/diversity3.webp" class="img img2text" alt="Women in white dress">
                <b>Education and Training:</b> Not everyone has access to the same opportunities to learn tech skills. Girls might not get as many chances to study STEM subjects or get the resources they need to learn tech stuff.<br>
                <b>Work-Life Balance:</b> Tech jobs can be pretty demanding, with lots of long hours and tight deadlines. Balancing work and other stuff, like family, can be tough for anyone, but especially for girls in IT.<br>
                <b>Workplace Culture:</b> Some workplaces aren't very welcoming to girls, with issues like harassment or a lack of chances to move up. It's important for everyone to feel safe and supported at work.<br>
                <b>Lack of Mentorship and Networking:</b> Girls might not have as many chances to connect with people who can help them out in the tech world, like mentors or networks of other women.
                </p>
                <p>
                It's super important to break down these barriers and make the tech world more inclusive for everyone. That could mean things like setting up mentor programs, making sure everyone gets fair opportunities, and creating a workplace where everyone feels respected. By tackling these issues, we can make sure girls have the same shot as anyone else at rocking it in the tech industry and bringing fresh ideas to the table!
